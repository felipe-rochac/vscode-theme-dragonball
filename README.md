# Dragon Ball VS Code Themes

A collection of dark, character-accurate Visual Studio Code themes inspired by Dragon Ball! Each theme is carefully crafted to match the palette and spirit of a specific character, with advanced syntax highlighting (including Go/golang), Dracula-style UI coverage, and unique touches for each hero and villain.

## Included Themes
- Goku
- Vegeta
- Gohan
- Frieza
- Majin Buu
- Broly
- Beerus
- Dragon Ball (classic)
- Super Saiyan Blue
- Trunks
- Android 18
- Cell
- Piccolo
- Jiren (ultra-dark, red/gray)
- Super Saiyan 4 (deep red, gold, brown)

## Features
- **Character-accurate palettes**: Each theme uses colors inspired by the character's design.
- **Dracula-style UI coverage**: Activity bar, status bar, side bar, title bar, tabs, panels, and more.
- **Advanced Go (golang) syntax highlighting**:
  - `entity.name.import.go`: Imported package name
  - `variable.other.package.go`: Package references in code (e.g., `uuid` in `uuid.New()`), bold and colored
  - `entity.name.import.path.go`: Last part of import path (e.g., `uuid` in `github.com/google/uuid`), bold, colored, and underlined
- **Consistent, modern look**: All themes are visually balanced and easy on the eyes.
- **Ultra-dark options**: Piccolo, Cell, Jiren, and Super Saiyan 4 are especially suited for dark environments.
